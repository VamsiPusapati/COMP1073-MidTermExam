The country may be going through an economic crisis, but many travellers say that it hasn't impacted the experience of visiting. Plus, there may be some great deals.Greece has 1,400 islands, though only 230 of them are inhabited.And while everyone knows about Santorini and Mykonos, there are gorgeous lesser-known islands in Greece, too.";

Rugged and remote, without chain hotels or package tours — not even a bank or ATM — and accessible only by ferry, the volcanic island boasts solitude in spades, secluded beaches, and incredible sunsets.";

The spectacular spot's crystal clear waters and beautiful beaches are perfect for diving, and its lush flora and dense forests ideal for hikes. Since the rich landscape is chock full of indigenous herbs, it's also known for its traditional medicine, and home of the International Academy of Homeopathy.";

Spetses was hot in the '60s, when it hosted Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, and remains a swanky summer retreat for Athens' glitterati to this day, full of fancy hotels, mansions and yachts, and stylish boutiques. Aside from a handful of locally-owned cabs, the four-mile-long island has banned cars in town, giving it a refreshingly 19th-century vibe, with horse-drawn carriages being a common sight.";
